# Lessons Learned
<br>
-The film query project helped me become more comfortable with writing SQL queries and<br> how SQL and Java can be used with each other to extract data from a database to populate the data of the program.<br><br>
-I learned how to:<br>
	-Connect to a MySQL relational Database<br>
	-Set up dependencies in the pom.xml from MAVEN, and linking the application to the mysql database.<br>
	-Use foreign keys to build relationships between tables<br>
